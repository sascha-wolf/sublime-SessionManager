Sublime-SessionManager
======================

Why?
----

Let's be honest: Sublime Texts session management is weird.
It doesn't outright suck but it's unflexible and hard to use if you don't have a project file.

As long as you work in a single project everything is fine, but as soon as you want have multiple projects open at once,
or just want to open a bunch of files and hack away, the sublimes session management screws you over.

Sometimes you simply want to save your current state, do something different and come back to wherever you left.
Preferably quick and uncomplicated.

If you've ever been in such a situation then this plugin is for you.

How to use
----------

Using Session Manager you can "save", "load" and "delete" your current state.
It handles all currently opened windows, folders and files, down to the currently visible region and all selections and cursors.

When you load a session you can continue your work as if nothing ever happened.

The commands in question are:

     Session Manager: Save Session
     Session Manager: Load Session
     Session Manager: Delete Session

The default name for a session consists of the keyword session and the current timestamp (example: session_15-03-13T15-37-22).
If you don't like the format you can configure it with via the "session_name_format" setting.

Each of your sessions will be saved in a "Packages/User/sessions" folder. This can be changed via the "session_path" setting.

The sessions are simple JSON files; this means you can edit and change them as you see fit.

Configuration
-------------

Just take a look at the default configuration file to learn about the available options:

    {
        // If session_path is null, the sessions will be saved in your sublime User folder in sessions
        // (User/sessions)
        "session_path": null,

        // The format which shall be used to generate the default session name;
        // Example result: session_15-02-07T15-09-32
        // take a look at the python docs for details:
        // https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior
        "session_name_format": "session_%y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%S"
    }


Plans for the future
--------------------

These are the features I'm planning to add in the future:

- Save only current window
- Close everything and open a new window after saving (configurable or another command?)
- More information when loading sessions (so we can easier distinguish between them)

If you think I should add some other features then don't hesitate to open an issue.

Happy session saving!
